# AI-Powered-Smart-Trash-Bin-for-Infant-Detection-
This project is about building a smart trash bin that can detect if an infant is near or inside it using AI. The system uses image processing and machine learning to recognize human presence, especially babies, and stops the bin from operating to avoid any accidents. It helps make waste management smarter and safer.
